# Graph Visualization Improvements

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Title Overlapping with Plots**
- **Problem**: `plt.suptitle()` was overlapping with the top row of subplots
- **Solution**: Added `y=0.98` parameter to position title higher and used `rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95]` in `tight_layout()` to reserve space

### 2. **Figure Size and Spacing**
- **Problem**: Plots were too cramped and hard to read
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased figure width from 15 to 16 inches
  - Increased subplot height from 3 to 3.5 inches per row
  - Better spacing with `tight_layout(rect=...)`

### 3. **Legend Clutter**
- **Problem**: Every subplot had a legend, creating visual clutter
- **Solution**: 
  - Show legends only on first row and total row
  - Moved legends to upper-left position for better visibility
  - Increased legend font size to 8pt with semi-transparent background

### 4. **High Load Points**
- **Problem**: Red scatter points were always shown even when no high load existed
- **Solution**: Only show high load scatter points when `high_load.any()` is True

### 5. **Typography Improvements**
- **Problem**: Titles and labels were not prominent enough
- **Solution**:
  - Made column titles bold with larger font (12pt)
  - Made "TOTAL" row label bold
  - Improved xlabel font size

## Result:
- ✅ Clear, readable plots with no overlapping elements
- ✅ Better use of space with appropriate margins
- ✅ Reduced visual clutter while maintaining all important information
- ✅ Professional appearance suitable for reports and presentations

## Usage:
```bash
# Generate plots with improved visualization
python simple_solver_cli.py data/easy-test --mode x --margin 0.9

# View the generated plots
python view_plots.py
```

The plots now show:
- Resource usage over time for each cluster (CPU, Memory, VF)
- Before/after comparisons when available
- High load periods highlighted in red
- Total resource usage across all clusters
- Clear legends and titles without overlapping
