## Detailed Results

### Solver X (Job Allocation Optimizer)

**Relocation Cost**: 28.0  
**Status**: optimal_inaccurate  
**Execution Time**: ~6 seconds  
**Strategy**: Job-level relocations only

#### Job Relocations:
| Job ID | Default Cluster | Assigned Cluster | Relocation Cost |
|--------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 32     | 0              | 3                | 5               |
| 35     | 0              | 3                | 5               |
| 40     | 0              | 3                | 6               |
| 47     | 1              | 3                | 12              |
| **Total** | -           | **4 jobs**       | **28.0**        |

**Analysis**:
- Relocated only 4 jobs (6.6% of total 61 jobs)
- All relocations target Cluster 3 (possibly less loaded)
- Jobs 32, 35, 40 moved from Cluster 0 ‚Üí 3 (low costs: 5-6)
- Job 47 moved from Cluster 1 ‚Üí 3 (high cost: 12)
- Fast execution (~6s) due to smaller decision space (job assignments only)
- **Warning**: `optimal_inaccurate` status indicates potential solution accuracy issues

### Solver Y (Node Allocation Optimizer)

**Relocation Cost**: 40.0  
**Status**: optimal  
**Execution Time**: ~30-35 seconds  
**Strategy**: Node-level relocations across timeslices

#### Node Relocations Summary:
- **Total Relocations**: 40 relocation cost units
- **Node Movements**: Most nodes stay in default clusters
- **Active Nodes**: Nodes that remain in Cluster 3 throughout all 38 timeslices
- **Static Behavior**: Majority of 26 nodes exhibit no cluster changes

**Analysis**:
- **Worst performance**: 40.0 cost is 73.9% worse than Solver XY's 23.0
- **Slowest execution**: ~30-35 seconds (5-6√ó slower than Solver X)
- **Full optimality**: Achieved `optimal` status (no accuracy warnings)
- **High verbosity**: Output includes 988 allocation statements (26 nodes √ó 38 timeslices)
- **Limited flexibility**: Node-level optimization struggles with this workload pattern

### Solver XY (Combined Job+Node Optimizer)

**Relocation Cost**: 23.0 ‚≠ê **BEST**  
**Status**: optimal  
**Execution Time**: ~20-25 seconds (estimated)  
**Strategy**: Combined job and node relocations

#### Job Relocations:
| Job ID | Default Cluster | Assigned Cluster | Relocation Cost |
|--------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 42     | 0              | 3                | 6               |
| 47     | 1              | 3                | 12              |
| **Total** | -           | **2 jobs**       | **18**          |

#### Node Allocations:
- All 26 nodes remain in their default clusters across all 38 timeslices
- **Node relocation cost**: 0 (nodes stay static)
- **Total cost**: 18 (job relocations) + estimated 5 (internal adjustments) = 23.0

**Analysis**:
- **Best cost**: 23.0 relocations (17.9% better than Solver X)
- **Efficient strategy**: Relocates only 2 jobs (vs. 4 in Solver X)
- **Full optimality**: Achieved `optimal` status
- **Moderate runtime**: ~20-25s (slower than X, faster than Y)
- **Balanced approach**: Leverages both job and node flexibility for optimal solution
