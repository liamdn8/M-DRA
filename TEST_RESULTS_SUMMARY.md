## üéØ Recommendations

### Production Deployment

**Primary Recommendation**: **Use Solver XY with margin 0.7**

**Rationale**:
- ‚úÖ Best or tied-best quality across all margins
- ‚úÖ Most robust (handles down to margin 0.35)
- ‚úÖ Acceptable execution time (~22 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Optimizes both jobs and nodes (comprehensive)
- ‚úÖ Never worse than X or Y alone

**Expected Performance**:
- Relocation cost: 14.0
- Execution time: ~22 seconds
- Success rate: 100%

### Alternative Strategies

**When Speed is Critical** (< 10 second requirement):
- Use **Solver X** with margin ‚â• 0.7
- Provides same quality as XY at loose margins
- 4√ó faster execution
- Limitation: Only optimizes jobs, degrades at tight margins

**When Resources are Very Tight** (margin < 0.5):
- **Must use Solver XY**
- X degrades significantly (cost increases 36-38)
- Y fails or performs very poorly
- Be prepared for longer solve times (up to 45 seconds)

**Do NOT Use Solver Y**:
- ‚ùå Consistently 40-50% worse quality
- ‚ùå 10√ó slower than X
- ‚ùå Limited feasibility (fails at margin 0.35)
- ‚ùå Not suitable for this dataset type

---

## üìà Key Findings

### 1. Combined Optimization Superiority
- **Solver XY never worse than X or Y alone**
- At tight margins (< 0.5), XY significantly outperforms X
- Joint optimization of jobs + nodes provides best results

### 2. Speed vs Quality Trade-off
- Solver X fastest but limited (job-only)
- Solver XY 4√ó slower but comprehensive
- **22 seconds acceptable for production**
- Trade-off favors XY for quality-critical deployments

### 3. Margin Sensitivity
- All solvers degrade as margin tightens
- XY maintains quality better than X at tight margins
- Y degrades most severely (cost doubles from margin 0.6 to 0.5)

### 4. Dataset Characteristics
- **Job relocation more effective than node relocation** for this dataset
- Explains why Y performs poorly (limited to node optimization)
- XY leverages both dimensions effectively

### 5. Robustness Advantage
- XY handles tightest constraints (margin 0.35)
- Critical for resource-constrained or high-utilization scenarios
- Provides operational flexibility

## ‚úÖ Final Conclusion

### Overall Winner: **Solver XY** üèÜ

**Across both datasets, Solver XY consistently demonstrates**:
1. **Best cost efficiency** (13-20% better at tight margins)
2. **Superior scaling** (64% vs. 100% cost increase)
3. **High robustness** (tied for best minimum margins)
4. **Acceptable performance** (30-50s execution time)
5. **Consistent quality** (never worse than X or Y alone)

---

### Deployment Strategy (Universal):

**Primary**: **Solver XY with margin 0.6-0.7**
- Best for production deployments
- Optimal cost-performance balance
- Scales well with dataset growth

**Fallback**: **Solver X with margin ‚â•0.7**
- Use when <10s execution is mandatory
- Acceptable quality for loose margins
- Fast approximation for large batches

**Avoid**: **Solver Y**
- Poor cost efficiency (2-3√ó worse)
- Unreliable execution time
- Not suitable for tested workload patterns

---

### Key Insights from Cross-Dataset Testing:

1. **Solver XY advantage grows with dataset size**
   - Small-sample: Tied with X at many margins
   - Medium-sample: Dominates at 72.7% of margins
   - Extrapolation: Expected to dominate at large scales (100+ jobs)

2. **Scaling validates XY's combined optimization approach**
   - 64% cost increase vs. 52% job increase (near-linear)
   - X/Y both double costs (poor scaling)
   - Critical for growing production workloads

3. **Minimum margin degradation is consistent**
   - All solvers lose ~0.10 margin (28% degradation)
   - Predictable for capacity planning
   - XY/X maintain parity, Y falls behind

4. **Execution time scales sub-linearly**
   - All solvers show <52% time increase
   - XY remains within acceptable bounds (<50s)
   - Performance predictable for larger datasets
