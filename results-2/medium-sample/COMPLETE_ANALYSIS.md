## Cost-Benefit Decision Matrix

### Scenario-Based Recommendations

| Scenario | Primary Solver | Backup | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| **Production Optimization** | **Solver XY** | - | Best costs (avg 13% better than X at low margins) |
| **Time-Critical (<10s)** | **Solver X** | - | Consistent 9s runtime, acceptable quality |
| **Tight Margins (0.45-0.55)** | **Solver XY** | Solver X | XY averages 15% better cost |
| **Moderate Margins (0.70-0.85)** | **Solver XY** or **Solver X** | Either | Both competitive, choose based on time constraints |
| **Relaxed Margins (>0.90)** | **Any Solver** | - | All achieve zero cost |
| **Unknown Workload** | **Solver XY** | Solver X | Best overall robustness |
| **Large-Scale Batch** | **Solver XY** | - | Better scaling characteristics |

### Avoid Solver Y For:
‚ùå Medium-sample workloads (consistently 40-60 cost)  
‚ùå Tight margins (<0.55) - risk of timeout  
‚ùå Time-sensitive applications - highly variable runtime  
‚ùå Production deployments - poor cost efficiency

   - Superior scaling characteristics (64% cost increase vs. 52% job increase)
   - Acceptable execution time (30-47s)

2. **Solver X excels in speed** but sacrifices cost efficiency
   - Fastest execution (~9s consistently)
   - Acceptable quality for non-critical applications
   - Tied minimum margin (0.45)
   - Good for rapid prototyping

3. **Solver Y is not suitable** for this workload type
   - 40-60 relocation cost (2-3√ó worse than XY)
   - Worst minimum margin (0.50)
   - Highly variable execution time
   - Poor scaling properties

### Production Guidance:

For **medium-sample-scale workloads (60-80 jobs, 25-30 nodes)**:
- **Primary**: Use Solver XY for optimal cost
- **Fallback**: Use Solver X for time-critical scenarios (<10s requirement)
- **Avoid**: Solver Y (poor cost-efficiency)

### Operating Range:
- **Recommended margin**: 0.60-0.75 (good balance of cost and feasibility)
- **Minimum safe margin**: 0.50 (with Solver XY)
- **Absolute minimum**: 0.45 (Solver XY/X only, emergency use)

### Next Steps:
1. Test on larger datasets (100+ jobs) to validate scaling predictions
2. Investigate Solver XY's "optimal_inaccurate" warnings at tight margins
3. Develop automated margin selection algorithm based on workload characteristics
4. Create cost prediction models for capacity planning
