## üí° Key Insights from Execution Time Analysis

### 1. Solver X: The Consistency King
- **Always ~9 seconds** regardless of margin difficulty
- Standard deviation of only 0.7s (7% of average)
- Fastest execution at all margins
- **Perfect for**: Production systems where predictability matters

### 2. Solver Y: The Unpredictable Slowpoke
- Execution time ranges from 18s to 196s (10.7x variation!)
- Standard deviation (55.5s) is **longer than the average** (52.7s)
- Slowest solver at all margins
- **Avoid unless**: Node allocation is the only concern

### 3. Solver XY: The Balanced Performer
- Stable 28-43s range (1.5x variation)
- 3.6x slower than X, but 1.6x faster than Y
- Moderate consistency (4.4s std dev)
- **Best for**: Quality-critical scenarios where 30-40s is acceptable

### 4. Margin Doesn't Affect Solver X
- X takes ~9s at margin 0.45 (hardest) and ~9s at margin 1.00 (easiest)
- Suggests job allocation complexity is independent of margin tightness
- Reliable performance regardless of problem difficulty

### 5. Solver Y Has Mysterious Slowdowns
- Extremely slow at margins: 0.85 (196s), 0.55 (134s), 0.75 (57s)
- No clear pattern - not related to margin tightness
- Suggests node allocation problem has edge cases that cause poor performance
- Makes Y unsuitable for production (unpredictable SLAs)

## üìà Recommendations Update (With Execution Time)

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Margin Range | Time Budget | Recommended Solver | Expected Time | Expected Quality |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Real-time optimization | Any | <15s | **X** | ~9s | Good-Excellent |
| Batch optimization | ‚â•0.75 | <60s | **X** | ~9s | Excellent |
| Batch optimization | 0.60-0.75 | <60s | **XY** | ~30s | Excellent |
| Critical reconfig | 0.45-0.60 | <60s | **XY** | ~30-40s | Best |
| No time limit | ‚â•0.75 | Any | **X** | ~9s | Excellent |
| No time limit | <0.75 | Any | **XY** | ~30-40s | Best |

### Production Deployment Strategy

**Recommended**: Deploy both X and XY with intelligent selection

```python
def select_solver(margin, time_budget_seconds):
    """Select optimal solver based on margin and time constraints"""
    
    # If time is very tight, only X can meet it
    if time_budget_seconds < 15:
        return 'solver_x'
    
    # At high margins, X is best (quality + speed)
    if margin >= 0.75:
        return 'solver_x'
    
    # At moderate margins, check time budget
    if margin >= 0.60:
        if time_budget_seconds < 35:
            return 'solver_x'  # Good enough, much faster
        else:
            return 'solver_xy'  # Better quality
    
    # At tight margins, XY is significantly better
    if margin >= 0.45:
        if time_budget_seconds >= 45:
            return 'solver_xy'
        else:
            return 'solver_x'  # Compromise speed for quality
    
    # Below 0.45, all solvers fail
    return None  # Infeasible
```

## üéì What We Learned

1. **Solver X is the speed demon**: Consistently fast, great for real-time use
2. **Solver XY is the quality champion**: Best at tight margins, worth the wait
3. **Solver Y is not production-ready**: Slow, unpredictable, worst results
4. **Execution time matters**: Can vary 21x between solvers at same margin
5. **Predictability matters**: X's consistency makes it safer for SLA-bound systems
6. **Quality vs Speed tradeoff exists**: XY gives 10-20% better quality for 3.6x slower execution
7. **Right tool for the job**: Use X for speed, XY for quality, never Y
