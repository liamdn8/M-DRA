## Recommendations

### Use Solver X When:
- ‚úÖ Speed is critical (real-time, high-frequency optimization)
- ‚úÖ Margin is moderate (0.65-0.85)
- ‚úÖ Execution time budget < 15 seconds
- ‚úÖ Small cost differences acceptable

**Best For**: Production systems, routine reoptimization, interactive tools

### Use Solver XY When:
- ‚úÖ Optimality is critical (minimize relocations)
- ‚úÖ Margin is tight (0.45-0.60)
- ‚úÖ Execution time budget 30-60 seconds
- ‚úÖ Need lowest possible minimum margin

**Best For**: Critical reconfigurations, capacity planning, tight constraints

### Avoid Solver Y Because:
- ‚ùå Consistently worst results (40-60 vs 14-48)
- ‚ùå Highly variable execution time (18-196s)
- ‚ùå Higher minimum margin (0.50 vs 0.45)
- ‚ùå No advantage over X or XY in any scenario

**Exception**: Only use if node allocation is the exclusive concern and job allocation is fixed

## Solver XY Advantages Over X

At tight margins (0.45-0.60), Solver XY provides:

| Margin | X Cost | XY Cost | Savings | % Better |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| 0.45 | 48.0 | 43.0 | 5.0 | 10.4% |
| 0.50 | 44.0 | 37.0 | 7.0 | 15.9% |
| 0.55 | 40.0 | 32.0 | 8.0 | 20.0% |
| 0.60 | 34.0 | 32.0 | 2.0 | 5.9% |

**Average Improvement**: 13.0%

**Cost**: 3.5x slower execution (9s ‚Üí 32s)

**ROI**: Worth it when every relocation matters

## Solver X Advantages Over XY

At moderate margins (0.75-0.85), Solver X provides:

| Margin | X Cost | XY Cost | Savings | Speed Gain |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| 0.85 | 14.0 | 18.0 | 4.0 (22%) | 3.3x faster |
| 0.80 | 16.0 | 17.0 | 1.0 (6%) | 3.6x faster |
| 0.75 | 22.0 | 22.0 | 0.0 (0%) | 3.3x faster |

**Average Improvement**: 9.3% better + 3.4x faster

**ROI**: Clear winner in this range

## Production Guidelines

### Decision Tree

```
Is margin >= 0.90?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use Solver X (fastest, same result)
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Is margin >= 0.75?
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use Solver X (best quality + speed)
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Is margin >= 0.60?
        ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use Solver XY (better quality)
        ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Is margin >= 0.45?
            ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use Solver XY (only good option)
            ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí INFEASIBLE (all solvers fail)
```

### Time Budget Considerations

| Time Budget | Recommended Solver | Expected Margin Coverage |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| < 10s | Solver X only | 0.45-1.00 |
| 10-30s | Solver X | 0.45-1.00 |
| 30-60s | Solver XY for ‚â§0.70, X for >0.70 | 0.45-1.00 |
| > 60s | Solver XY (maximum quality) | 0.45-1.00 |
